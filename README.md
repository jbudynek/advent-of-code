# Advent of code

Usual disclaimer: the code gets the job done. It's raw and mostly inelegant!

## 2022
...Python again!

## 2021
OK let's do this in Python again this year (and some Scratch for day one)!

## 2020
AOC 2020 completed! ... in Python (and some BASIC for day one).

## 2019
Completed AOC 2019 in Python! It was my first participation.
Mostly within Jupyter Notebooks at first, but in the end, Python scripts are easier.

## 2018-2017-2016-2015
Just for practice, in Python.
